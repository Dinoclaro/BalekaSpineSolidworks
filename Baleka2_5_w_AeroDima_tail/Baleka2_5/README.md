# Manufacturing + Assembly Tips
- Baleka 2.5 was originally manufactured using AL-1050 Aluminium, while structurally it is strong enough, the metal gets scuffed easily as it is softer. 
  It is recommended to use AL-5083 as it will show less visible wear and tear. 
- Plates can be manufactured at Vulcan of Fabrinox. Specify the surface finish or powder coating required.
  Needs to be collected if made at Vulcan. 
- Rear spacers are required for the motor mounting as the holes are blind, there is also not enough thread after the spacer for a 20mm M4 Cap screw to work. 
- A Half version can be made [Half_Leka]. This is created by using both outside plates and connecting them to a set of motors.
